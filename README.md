# Runic Dices Isometric 2D Game
A short 5 day project to display my proficiency with Unity and C# scripting. The project showcases a structure for an isometric 2D game with simple movement aligned with the isometric grid aswell as melee and ranged combat. 

The project was organised using a feature folder approach. Any assets including art, scripts, prefabs that are related to a specific feature are all kept within a folder for that feature. 

## Credits
For the project I used 2 seperate asset packs.
Assets for the player were created by itch user Sscary and can be found here: https://sscary.itch.io/the-adventurer-male
Assets for the tileset were created by itch user scrabling and can be found here: https://scrabling.itch.io/pixel-isometric-tiles
